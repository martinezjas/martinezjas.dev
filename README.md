# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website project! This website serves as a sandbox to hone my web development skills and to host a small project.

## Tech Stack

For this webiste, I've employed a combination of modern web technologies to ensure (maybe) an engaging and responsive user experience:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
- **Backend**: Python Flask run on a Gunicorn instance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap CSS
- **Version Control**: Git for efficient code management and collaboration
- **Hosting**: The website is hosted on a virtual private server located somewhere in the US

Feel free to explore the website, and I'd love to hear your feedback! This project reflects my journey in the world of web development and design, and I hope it provides value to fellow developers, designers, and curious minds.
